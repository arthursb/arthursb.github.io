## About the project

Cloud Quest is a gamefied learning experience that teaches players how to use Amazon's cloud computing services to solve real world problems. Each NPC provides a task that must be validated throught AWS Console. The games also offers other gameplay experiences, such as city customization, quizzes, and collectibles.

My most significant contribution was in a major UI/UX revamp in 2022. Check the before & after comparison below:
