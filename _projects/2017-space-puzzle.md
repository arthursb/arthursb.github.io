## About the project

2001: Space Puzzle is a sliding puzzle game inspired by Sokoban and Kakuro. To win, players must match the values of ally and enemy ships on both lines and columns. Features include: different obstacles that may appear in the grid, four types of ships, each one with different properties, and a custom level creator.

Legacy apk build versions have been preserved by [APKPure](https://apkpure.com/2001-space-puzzle/com.AdvanceGames.DeltaFormation/versions).


## My contributions

- Brainstorm features
- Help with gameplay programming and bug fixing
- Integrate Unity code with native mobile plugins, such as AdSense and Analytics
- Help the main game designer create levels following a different creative approach 
- Monitor customer feedback and post-launch issues
- Maintain the stores pages and study how to reach a broader audience

## Results

The game was released in 2016 for iOS and Android and was maintained up to 2017. It reached organically an audience of over 1000 downloads and maintained a review score of 4.6 before getting delisted.
