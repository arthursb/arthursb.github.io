## About the project

Building up from [the previous release](https://arthursb.github.io/projects/2023-escaperoom-cpe), the second iteration prepares its players to the newest Foundational AI certification. It features a goofy storyline and considerably more varied puzzles to solve.

## My contributions

- Design environments for the game's levels
- Design and implement puzzles
- Optimize for WebGL
- Monitor production metrics

## Results

The game was showcased at [re:Invent 2024](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) and, just like its predecessor, was a huge success. It solidified the Game-Based Learning team's presence in the [AWS Training & Certification](https://www.aws.training/) organization.
