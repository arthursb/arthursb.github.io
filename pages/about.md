# About Me

I’m a passionate game developer, blending my expertise in UX design with creativity to craft high-quality, innovative multimedia experiences. 

My work spans a variety of areas, including mixed reality, augmented reality, simulators, and serious games. I pursue innovation and strive to create engaging and meaningful interactions that push the boundaries of what’s possible.

Here are a few curiosities about myself outside work:
* 👶🏻 I love spending time with my wonderful wife and baby girl.

* 📚 Studying more about software engineering, computer graphics, and user experience.

* 🎵 One day I will compose my own video game music!

* 🎮 Avid gamer and collector.

* 🏋️‍♂️ Trying to get back to CrossFit and gym.

* 🕹️ Former competitive Smash Bros. player (main Ness).

* 💀 Often known as "that Mono Black guy" by fellow MtG Commander players.

* 👾 Some of my all-time favorite games: *Metroid Prime*, *Golden Sun*, *Celeste*, *Super Meat Boy*, *NieR: Automata*, *Shin Megami Tensei IV*.
